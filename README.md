# k8study
Kubernetes, Vagrant, Ansible and Helm Case Study.
A basic configuration from scratch - vagrant setting up VM's for Kubernetes and KubeCTL to manage, 
and Ansible to automate deployment by playbooks.
Additional guest of the episode - Helm, because installing Wordpress by hand would be a pain.

This is not meant to be used in production environments - i had zero knowledge about each of the mentioned technologies
when i started - so be warned, don't let hell loose, and don't even try to run it on production.
I'm fresh enough to produce high quality errors, you know, brainlessly copy-pasting it is 
quite a fine thing to do when you want to see if Kubernetes is flammable or if it can explode.

You've been warned.

If you want to learn without repeating my mistakes, check out fi. theese guys - they surely do know better.
https://github.com/learnitguide/kubernetes-and-ansible - i couldn't do it without them.
Also, keep in mind, that Google is your best friend. Whole world's knowledge at a fingertip. Just ask the magic question, and answer
you shall receive.
